Welcome, I'm Ollivier Robert, an oldish sysadmin / developer / architect in the UNIX world, currently working in Aviation, mostly in Surveillance, drones, and stuff.  Before, I was a Security Consultant for a few years.

My main interests, as you may see in my repositories, are [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX) and [Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) -related.  I have used a number of languages over the years, the main ones being, in no order whatsoever, C, Perl, Ruby, Go 🐹, and now Rust 🦀.  I also was a [FreeBSD](https://www.FreeBSD.org/) committer for like 25 years.  You may also know me for [Calife](https://keltia.net/programs/calife/) a lightweight sudo-like program, enabing people to become root securely.
